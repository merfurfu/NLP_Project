# NLP_Project
Using BERT to classify texts into spam or ham
In collaboration with Sienna Wu

Our project aims to use BERT models with a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset/data) to determine if text messages can be classified as spam opr not. 
We also added a compilation of personal text data to further refine our model.
